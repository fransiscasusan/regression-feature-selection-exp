# regression-feature-selection-exp
We  consider  sparse  regression  in  an  online  setting  for  problems  where  high-dimensional data arrive sequentially. We compare two recent methods: truncatedstochastic gradient descent (TSGD) and online least square with thresholding(OLST), and propose a hybrid method, OLST-then-TSGD. We implement thesealgorithms and compare their performances with each other and two offline sparseregression algorithms on synthetic and Wikiface images datasets.
